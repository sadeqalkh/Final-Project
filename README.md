Introductory phase, picking an intendent theme or getting inspiration from it.
First Theme
-	The Solar System Clock:

![Sketch 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60816393/78111908-70db3600-740e-11ea-94ba-ab2e4e3735e5.jpg)
My intension in this theme is to establish the relationship between motion/orbits and time, mostly inspired by physics. In which, motion is the phenomenon that an object changes its position over time. As it may seem complicated, creating this clock was not a challenge knowing that the Sun will be represented as hours, Earth as Minutes, and the Moon as seconds. I felt that it would be easy for the viewers to identify this element by there sizes. Because we know that the Sun is stable, I thought of implementing LED lights to represent hours and that the "Sun" is our source of energy.

Second Theme
-	The Walking Horse:

![Sketch 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60816393/78111978-95371280-740e-11ea-8d8c-7868de524df3.jpg)
My intension in this theme is to simply create a horse which walks to motivate time. 

Third Theme
-	The Wooden/Cardboard Gear Clock:

![Sketch 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60816393/78112145-d6c7bd80-740e-11ea-9d30-37ac9de5b623.jpg)
My intension in this theme is to establish the idea of what intrinsically motivates most clocks worldwide. The gears from this project will be moving ten revolutions every hour. The clock from this project, however, will not be driven by the demonstrated gears. In which, the clock in this project will be controlled by a stepper motor.

Narrowing the ideas into the theme of "One's Daily Habit." As I was thinking of a daily habit, examples like swimming and walking came in my mind in the beginning. Mainly because of how they tended to be more dynamic from my other practices. I then thought of photography; however, I felt that it would be challenging that is mostly because of how I defined motion in a picture but not the DSLR itself. Knowing that a camera is a static object, I started to explore how it might be dynamic to implement in a clock. I brought my camera beside me and started to separate the Lens from the DSLR. As I reached this stage, I discovered that there is indeed a dynamic motion with the DSLR's iris and shutter. Also, I realized that there is a physical motion implemented to the Lens's ND Filter by the user. As I discovered most of the movements in the Lens, I then started to sketch the main components of the dynamic Lens.

Updated design of the project:

At this point in the design, I have decided to simplify the main idea because of some issues that will encounter the final design. In which, I realized that as soon as the whole lens completes a revolution. The wires within will be forced to twist and, thus to damage it.

In sum, the IRIS by this stage will be considered the central element of the final design and encounter developments in Fusion 360.
The idea of having a clock and the Lens as an aesthetic shape will not be considered at this point, mainly because I want to focus more on an appealing motion of my habit.

Fusion 360 design components:

As I reached this stage, I have decided to implement a physical force to motive the IRIS movements instead of the stepper motor. Mainly because the motor was not accessible and that it will be easier to determine issues and developments in the fabrication.
